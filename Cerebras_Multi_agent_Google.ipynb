        "## The Problem\n",
        "Content creators, researchers, and marketers face a significant challenge when developing comprehensive material on specialized topics. The traditional research process is both time-consuming and labor-intensive:\n",
        "\n",
        "They must formulate effective search queries\n",
        "Sift through numerous search results manually\n",
        "Evaluate the relevance and credibility of sources\n",
        "Extract and organize key information\n",
        "Synthesize findings into coherent content\n",
        "Repeat this process multiple times to fill knowledge gaps\n",
        "\n",
        "This workflow can take hours or even days, delaying content production and limiting the number of topics a team can cover effectively. For small teams or individual creators without research assistants, this bottleneck severely impacts productivity.\n",
        "\n",
        "## The AI Solution\n",
        "Generative AI, as demonstrated in the code you shared, can transform this process through automated research assistance:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Query Optimization: The AI refines user queries to match search engine algorithms for better results (as shown in the format_search method)\n",
        "- Automated Information Gathering: Instead of manual searching, the AI conducts multiple search queries and aggregates the results\n",
        "- Intelligent Gap Analysis: The system evaluates the completeness of research and automatically identifies missing information (via the EditorAgent)\n",
        "- Iterative Research: The AI conducts multiple rounds of research until sufficient information is gathered, targeting different aspects of the topic with each iteration\n",
        "- Content Synthesis: When research is complete, the AI transforms raw research into well-structured content (via the WriterAgent)\n",
        "\n",
        "## Real-World Impact\n",
        "This AI-powered research workflow reduces what might take hours into minutes. Content creators can focus on refining and adding their unique perspective to AI-generated drafts rather than spending time on initial research and organization.\n",
        "The solution is particularly valuable for:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Marketing teams needing to create content across multiple product lines\n",
        "- Researchers exploring new domains quickly\n",
        "- Educational content creators covering diverse topics\n",
        "- Small businesses without dedicated research staff\n",
        "\n",
        "By increasing the number of search results (as you've requested), the system becomes even more effective, gathering a wider range of perspectives and information in each research iteration."

One investment vehicle that has gained popularity in recent years is the separately managed account (SMA). In this blog post, we will delve into the world of SMAs, exploring how they work, their benefits, and what investors need to know.\n\n**What is a Separately Managed Account?**\n\nA separately managed account is a type of investment account that allows investors to own individual securities directly. Unlike mutual funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs), SMAs offer a customized investment portfolio tailored to an individual's specific needs and goals [1]. In an SMA, the investor owns the underlying securities, and the investment manager has discretion to buy and sell securities on behalf of the investor.\n\n**How Does a Separately Managed Account Work?**\n\nHere's a step-by-step overview of how an SMA works:\n\n1. **Account Setup**: An investor opens an SMA with a financial institution or investment manager.\n2. **Investment Objective**: The investor and investment manager discuss and agree on an investment objective, such as growth, income, or capital preservation.\n3. **Portfolio Construction**: The investment manager creates a customized portfolio of individual securities that aligns with the investor's objective.\n4. **Portfolio Management**: The investment manager actively manages the portfolio, buying and selling securities as needed to achieve the investor's objective.\n5. **Reporting and Monitoring**: The investment manager provides regular reporting and monitoring of the portfolio's performance.\n\n**Benefits of Separately Managed Accounts**\n\nSMAs offer several benefits to investors, including:\n\n* **Customization**: SMAs allow investors to have a tailored investment portfolio that meets their specific needs and goals.\n* **Transparency**: Investors have complete visibility into the underlying securities and can see exactly what they own.\n* **Control**: Investors have more control over their investments, as they can make changes to the portfolio as needed.\n* **Tax Efficiency**: SMAs can be more tax-efficient than mutual funds or ETFs, as investors only pay taxes on the capital gains realized in their account.\n\n**Types of Separately Managed Accounts**\n\nThere are several types of SMAs available, including:\n\n* **Equity SMAs**: Focus on stocks and equities.\n* **Fixed Income SMAs**: Focus on bonds and fixed income securities.\n* **Multi-Asset SMAs**: Offer a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, and other asset classes.\n\n**Who is a Separately Managed Account Suitable For?**\n\nSMAs are suitable for a wide range of investors, including:\n\n* **High Net Worth Individuals**: SMAs offer a high level of customization and control, making them an attractive option for high net worth individuals.\n* **Institutional Investors**: SMAs can be used by institutional investors, such as pension funds or endowments, to manage their investment portfolios.\n* **Financial Advisors**: Financial advisors can use SMAs to offer customized investment solutions to their clients.\n\n**Best Practices for Investing in Separately Managed Accounts**\n\nWhen investing in an SMA, it's essential to:\n\n* **Clearly Define Your Investment Objective**: Work with your investment manager to define your investment objective and risk tolerance.\n* **Choose an Experienced Investment Manager**: Select an investment manager with a proven track record of success in managing SMAs.\n* **Monitor and Adjust Your Portfolio**: Regularly review your portfolio and make adjustments as needed to ensure it remains aligned with your investment objective.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSeparately managed accounts offer a unique and flexible investment solution for investors seeking customization and control. By understanding how SMAs work and their benefits, investors can make informed decisions about whether an SMA is right for them. Whether you're a high net worth individual or an institutional investor, SMAs can provide a tailored investment portfolio that meets your specific needs and goals.\n\nFor more information on SMAs, investors can refer to [1] and [2]. Additionally, for those interested in sustainable and impact investing, the US SIF organization provides valuable resources and education [3].\n\n**References:**\n\n[1] https://smartasset.com/investing/separately-managed-account \n\n[2] https://am.jpmorgan.com/content/dam/jpm-am-aem/americas/us/en/smas/bro-sma.pdf \n\n[3] https://www.ussif.org/sribasics \n"

            "A separately managed account is a type of investment account that allows investors to own individual securities directly. Unlike mutual funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs), SMAs offer a customized investment portfolio tailored to an individual's specific needs and goals [1]. In an SMA, the investor owns the underlying securities, and the investment manager has discretion to buy and sell securities on behalf of the investor.\n",
